      "\n",
      "1.  **Signature Style and Artist Identification/Market Value:** A \"signature style\" is described as something that \"immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's.\" This style is tightly coupled with the artist's identity, making their work instantly recognizable, like Roy Lichtenstein's cartoon-like paintings. Furthermore, this signature style is often tightly coupled with **market value**, as buyers \"pay a lot for such work\" because it's identifiable and unique to a specific artist.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Painting Still Lives and Curiosity/Close Observation:** The author found a tight coupling between painting still lives and his own **curiosity** about what he was seeing. He explains that painting still lives forces one to \"look more closely\" and notice details that are usually taken for granted in everyday visual perception. This process of painting still lives is inherently linked to a deep, analytical observation of the subject, allowing one to emphasize visual cues and create paintings that are \"more realistic than photographs\" in an \"information-theoretic sense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the documents also highlight instances where things were *not* tightly coupled:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Art School (Painting Department) and Learning/Rigor:** The author observed that the painting department at the Accademia had an arrangement where \"students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\" Similarly, at RISD, he noted that \"art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine,\" at least not in the painting department, which was \"post-rigorous.\" This suggests a lack of tight coupling between the painting curriculum and actual rigorous learning or skill development for many students. However, other departments like textile, illustration, and architecture *did* seem rigorous, implying a tighter coupling between instruction and learning in those areas.\n"
