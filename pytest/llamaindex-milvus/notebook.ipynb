This insight directly influenced the naming, branding, and funding model of Y Combinator.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Obsolete Customs in Venture Capital and Online Essay Publishing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **General Principle:** The text highlights a general lesson that \"Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared\" [12]. This means that practices established under old conditions often remain, even when those conditions no longer apply.\n",
      "*   **Online Essay Publishing:** In the realm of essay writing, customs were initially shaped by the \"constraints of the print era\" [12]. However, with the advent of the internet, \"publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version,\" which was a departure from simply putting content online in the 90s [11]. Despite this shift, some customs from the print era still influenced how essays were perceived or written.\n",
      "*   **Venture Capital Practices:** Similarly, \"Customary VC practice had once... been based on real constraints\" [12]. Startups used to be much more expensive to launch and, consequently, rarer. However, even as startups became \"cheap and common,\" the \"VCs' customs still reflected the old world\" [12]. An example of this outdated thinking is the term \"deal flow,\" which implies a fixed number of new startups at any given time. The author explicitly states, \"I've never liked the term 'deal flow,' because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed\" [15]. This demonstrates how traditional VC customs were out of sync with the new reality of startup creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Connection to Y Combinator's Naming, Branding, and Funding Model:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The understanding that independent-minded individuals have an advantage in fields undergoing rapid change (where customs are likely obsolete) directly informed Y Combinator's approach [12]. YC actively sought to break away from these outdated customs:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Naming:** Y Combinator's original name was \"Cambridge Seed,\" which was a regional name. However, they deliberately changed it because they \"didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley.\" Instead, they renamed themselves \"after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator\" [13]. This move rejected the customary regional naming conventions for investment firms, opting for a more abstract and universal identity that wouldn't be constrained by geography.\n",
      "*   **Branding:** YC's branding also consciously defied traditional VC customs. The author \"picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it.\" In 2005, VCs typically used \"staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green\" because they were trying to appeal to Limited Partners (LPs), not founders. YC's choice of orange and its logo (a white Y on an orange square, an inside joke referencing the Viaweb logo) was a direct rejection of these established, conservative branding norms, aiming instead to appeal to founders and project a distinct, innovative image [13].\n",
      "*   **Funding Model:** YC's core purpose was to challenge the traditional VC mindset, particularly the notion of \"deal flow.\" Its goal was to actively \"falsify\" the idea that the number of startups is fixed by \"causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed\" [15]. This proactive approach to startup creation was a significant departure from the passive \"deal flow\" model. While YC did become a fund for a couple of years starting in 2009 because it grew too large to be personally funded, it returned to being self-funded after the acquisition of Heroku, indicating a preference for independence from traditional fund structures [14]. This reflects a desire to maintain control and avoid the constraints that might come with traditional funding models, which could perpetuate obsolete customs.\n"
